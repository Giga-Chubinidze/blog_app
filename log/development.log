DEPRECATION WARNING: config.active_storage.replace_on_assign_to_many is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 7.1. Make sure that your code works well with config.active_storage.replace_on_assign_to_many set to true before upgrading. To append new attachables to the Active Storage association, prefer using `attach`. Using association setter would result in purging the existing attached attachments and replacing them with new ones.

DEPRECATION WARNING: config.active_storage.replace_on_assign_to_many is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 7.1. Make sure that your code works well with config.active_storage.replace_on_assign_to_many set to true before upgrading. To append new attachables to the Active Storage association, prefer using `attach`. Using association setter would result in purging the existing attached attachments and replacing them with new ones.

DEPRECATION WARNING: config.active_storage.replace_on_assign_to_many is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 7.1. Make sure that your code works well with config.active_storage.replace_on_assign_to_many set to true before upgrading. To append new attachables to the Active Storage association, prefer using `attach`. Using association setter would result in purging the existing attached attachments and replacing them with new ones.
